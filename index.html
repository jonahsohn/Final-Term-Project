  <h3>Childhood Dreams</h3>           
   <img class="entries-image" src="jonahdoctor.JPG">                         
   <p><strong>From the time</strong> that I was old enough to realize what a dream was I had many. I had dreamt to become so many things year after year, and as I grew up it became a different dream every time. Sometimes I dreamt to be a professional soccer player, teacher, astronaut, and even the President of the United States. However as those dreams faded away, the one childhood dream I actually wanted to live out was to be just like my Grandfather who was a physician in the Navy Medical Corps. I looked up to my Grandfather who was beloved by many and is the smartest and most interesting person I’ve ever met. Although he passed away when I was just a child, I would still dress up as him for Halloween since I wanted to be just like him. Five years from now I will be 24 years old. If I were to ask myself back then where I would see myself at 24, I would probably say something along the lines of studying to become a doctor or across the seas as an officer in the U.S. Navy. That is funny to look back on as I am on a drastically different career path with other plans for my future.</p>

  <h3>Hobbies and Work Experiences</h3>   
  <img class="entries-image" src="nygiants.JPG">    
  <p><strong>In high school</strong>, I found my passion for financial markets and entrepreneurship. I went to Bergen County Academies which was not your typical high school. As a public magnet high school, Bergen County Academies offered me a unique high school experience that combined comprehensive academics with technical and professional courses. Being a part of the Academy of Business and Finance which is one of the seven specialized high school programs offered, I was able to explore my interests. Taking classes in accounting and having access to resources such as a Bloomberg Terminal fueled my passion for financial markets. I also was able to learn how to start my own sneaker company where I resell shoes. </p>   
  <p>One of my experiences in high school that I was extremely privileged to take part in was to intern for the NY Giants. In the senior year of high school, I was lucky to be accepted as an intern where I would learn more about organizational management and engage with players/coaches on the NY Giants Football team. It was a once in a lifetime experience where I was able to be on the sidelines for gameday and my family would see me on TV. This experience has led me to be heavily interested in sports management which is a field of business I would potentially want to work in the future.</p>

  <h3>Plans For My Future</h3>   
  <img class="entries-image" src="hongkong.jpeg">    
  <p><strong>In five years</strong>, I hope to find a career that makes me happy and is something I am also good at doing. After graduating college I want to be doing something I enjoy while also having a positive impact on other people. I would be open to doing something along the lines of working for a Nonprofit organization and managing their assets. Helping others around me is especially important to me and it makes my job even more rewarding. Although I am tentative to choose a career path right now, I am not afraid of committing and choosing the wrong track. According to a January 2018 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average person changes jobs ten to fifteen times (with an average of 12 job changes) during his or her career. Therefore, I know I will not be sticking to one thing for the rest of my life, and there will be plenty of opportunities to find a career that I find fulfilling. Taking advice from my favorite youtube channel Yes Theory, I want to seek discomfort and not have any regrets when I’m older. Ideally, I don’t want to have regret for things I didn’t do throughout life whether that’s skydiving or traveling to a dream destination. Therefore I wouldn’t be opposed to going on more trips across the world with my friends in five years. Above is a picture of me and my friends in Hong Kong where we traveled all across the region. It was honestly one of my fondest memories and as a person who has a passion for traveling, I would love to venture across the world with my friends as a 24 year old outside my comfort zone. </p>

 <h3>About Me</h3>  
  <p>Hi there! My name is Jonah Sohn and I am currently a sophomore at Washington and Lee University majoring in Business Administration with minors in Philosophy and Poverty and Human Capability Studies. On-campus I take part in a variety of activities such as being a Writing Center Tutor and a member of W&L’s Ethics Bowl Team.

I can’t wait to share my journey through life with you! </p>

  <h3>Inspiration</h3>  
  <p> This is a video from my favorite youtube channel Yes Theory whose motto is to Seek Discomfort. Sometimes the most amazing opportunties or lessons are outside our comfort zone. In the next 5 years of my life I want to become the best version of myself. Through seeking discomfort I hope to blindly and fearlessly pursue what I think will transform and grow me. </p>
